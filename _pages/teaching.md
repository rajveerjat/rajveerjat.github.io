## Selected Comments from Students

-Mr. Jat is an effective teaching assistant. He goes over the material in a clear and easy manner. It is easy to comprehend what he is talking
about. He is knowledgeable on what he is talking about and goes out of his way to make sure students understand him. I wish him all the
best in his future endeavors! Thank you for all that you have done!

-TA's approachability and responsiveness were outstanding, offering timely and constructive feedback on homework assignments. This
feedback was crucial for reinforcing key concepts and improving my understanding. The TA also created an engaging and supportive
learning environment, encouraging active participation and making sure all students felt comfortable asking questions. Overall, the TA's
effective teaching skills and dedication significantly contributed to my success in the course. His methods were highly effective and greatly
appreciated.

-Rajveer Jat is an exceptional instructor. I always looked forward to attending his discussion sections because I consistently learned
something new. I particularly appreciated how he took the time to introduce the goal of the discussion and key concepts before the start of
class and then revisited them at the end to ensure we were not lost. His thorough explanations and step-by-step approach ensured that
everyone grasped the material completely. I genuinely believe that I wouldn't have performed as well as I did without him as my TA. I wish he
could be the TA for all my classes. Sometimes, he had to cover a large number of questions, and it was quite challenging to ensure students
understood all the material. I was impressed to see that not only did he cover all the questions, but we were also able to follow all the steps.
His time management and ability to perform under pressure are outstanding. One point I want to highlight is that Rajveer cares about
diversity, inclusion, and equity. He designed his discussion sessions in a way that students from diverse backgrounds, in terms of culture and
educational experience, could follow along, and those with advanced degrees could also gain additional knowledge. There was something for
everyone in his class, and I always felt included. He used to take sufficient pauses whenever a key concept was introduced to ensure
students did not miss crucial points. He was incredibly open to questions and always treated everyone with respect. I especially valued how
he related complex matrix multiplication and statistical concepts to analogous linear one-dimensional problems, which helped me understand
the concepts. It also reinforced the material from the lectures. I'm truly grateful that Rajveer Jat was my TA for this class!

-The teaching assistant explains the subject effectively and manages a good classroom atmosphere. The discussion sessions greatly improve
my understanding of the course material.

-one of the best teachers I have ever had the pleasure of encountering. Takes time to provide real world examples and detailed explanations
whenever a student is confused. Gives great tips and tricks to solve problems better and provides a better way of understanding the material
through intuition and anecdotes that relate to the subject. Truly a spectacular instructor. Any university worth its salt would be lucky to have
him.

-Thank you teaching us Econ 107 empirical problems, state and a little bit about Python machine learning. I will definitely use one or more of
those skills in the future. Good luck on everything.

-The discussion were very helpful. They were more helpful and insightful than the actual lectures. Although I may have not done so well in this
course, whatever I did learn was thanks to this instructor.

-Instructor was overall very kind the grading. I really liked how the class is based on programming in R using data analysis. This is great
because the market is full of these types of roles and he is pretty much helping us obtain skills used in the real world. I would recommend him
to other students if he were a TA. Thank you for reading.

-The instructor was not only effective in teaching material that was directly applicable to the course, but also aided us in acquiring some
important skills for the job market as they pertained to the lecture material.

-The instructor did a good job of intuitively teaching the material, so as to be understood at a proficient level.

our lab sessions was very helpful and instrumental in my success as a student in this course.

-He was excellent, he went through each problem to really comprehend the ideas we were using.

-Rajveer is a nice TA. His materials are well organized and easy to follow, which is a good supplementary for the lecture notes. Raj fully
understand the materials and have the ability to discompose the hard core abstract concepts into easy ones. Strongly recommend!

-I liked how the TA helped to clarify concepts covered in class and explain the mathematical significance and the reason as to why we do our
economic math in a particular manner. He made sure that we all understood and took time to answer questions and clarify answers. Inclusion
of real world examples and asking for responses from the class to engage in the discussion section helped me learn better. I overall had a
great experience with this TA and his patience. Thank you!!

-Jat was a great TA. HE made sure we on track by asking us questions , engaging in the conversation, and making sure that students are
ready for the final. He answered all the questions we had and he welcomed the participation. This TA is the first TA I had so far that does an
actual discussions unlike other TA who shows up and write on the board then leave. Thank you Jat, Unknown.

attitude

-Prof. Rajveer Jat has demonstrated excellent teaching skills and deep academic knowledge during this semester. He not only possesses

-Great TA, keep up the great work and I wish you all well in the future.

-From all the times I have interacted with TA for help it has been great. Since my professor was so good at teaching, usually I didn't need
much help with learning any topic in this class.

-Works hard to get students to participate--would check to make sure students were participating well and offered interesting insight to
problems. Something didn't understand how it tied into the lectures but did a good job.

-Rajveer explains the contents of the subject very well and demonstrates a clear understanding of the information. He is able to answer
questions very well and we can definitely trust him to help us out!
